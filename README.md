<b>Levels</b>

Level 1: FLIGHT TRAINING  
A introductory level to get the player familiar with simple flying. Just follow the navigation arrow in the upper left corner of the screen towards the landing pads.

Level 2: MAILMAN, MAILMAN
Simple delivery featuring tethered crates. Navigate the level and drop the crates off at the specified destinations to complete the level.

Level 3:  I CAME IN LIKE A...
A boss fight level. The objective is to destroy the tower. Use your wrecking-cubes to destroy its Orbiting Rings of Death, then smash its weak center.

Level 4: Rock Me Like A Hurricane
Mission control needs you to collect rocks and deposit them in a pit, for scientific reasons you wouldn’t understand. Each of the 4 rock chutes will dispense 24 rocks. Get 50 rocks into the central pit to win the level.

Level 5: DANGEROUS GAME
Land on specific floating asteroids to collect samples and reach the surface of the large asteroid. Extremely vertical level where the player is forced to keep an eye out below the lander. This level will be present with the final build of the game.

Level 6: RETURN TO BASE
Get back to base before the time runs out. Be careful about fuel management though. Hazards will be added at a later time.


<b>Other Screens</b>

Introductory Screen:
This screen is meant to teach new players who don’t read directions how to use their thrusters. Just press the spacebar to fly a short distance, and you’ll be teleported to the level select screen.
Level Select Screen:
Each of the 3 terrains is a different level. To enter a level, fly your craft to one of the terrains.
Game Over Screen:
You arrive here when you’ve died due to your health hitting 0 or your fuel hitting 0. Use the mouse to select one of the two options.
 
<b>Important Metrics</b>
 
Health:
Health is diminished by colliding with terrain. When your health reaches 0, you die.
Fuel:
When your fuel runs out, you die. Fuel can be refilled by flying through the spinning gears present in some levels.
